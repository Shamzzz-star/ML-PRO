# Predicting Highway Fuel Efficiency Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of multiple linear regression to predict highway fuel efficiency. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide, including data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project appears to be a CSV file named `cars.csv`, which contains information on various car attributes. Key steps related to the dataset include:

- Loading the dataset using pandas.
- Describing the dataset to understand its statistical properties.
- Checking the dataset's shape and structure.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. **Introduction**:
   - Overview of the problem statement and objectives.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Initial exploration and visualization of the dataset.
   - Use of descriptive statistics to summarize key features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values, if any.
   - Feature engineering and selection.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Implementation of a multiple linear regression model.
   - Training the model on the dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error).
   - Visualizing results to interpret the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for regression modeling)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## Outputs
The notebook generates visualizations and metrics to help understand the performance of the multiple linear regression model in predicting highway fuel efficiency.



**Note**: Ensure the `cars.csv` dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.
